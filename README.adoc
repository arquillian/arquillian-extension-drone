The Arquillian Drone provides a simple way to write functional tests for an application with a web-based user interface.
Arquillian Drone brings the power of https://code.google.com/p/selenium[WebDriver] into the Arquillian framework. WebDriver provides a language how to communicate with a browser, like filling the forms, navigating on the pages and validating their content.

== Why should I use Arquillian Drone instead of plain WebDriver?
There are many reasons why you want to do that, the most important being:

* Life cycle management of the browser
* Interaction with deployments and containers provided by Arquillian
* Simple usage of multiple browsers in a single test
* Configuration kept on a single place, outside of the Java code
* Fully compatible with the IDE
* Integration with mobile based browsers testing (https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-droidium[Arquillian Droidium])
* Integration of JavaScript test suite execution (https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-qunit[Arquillian QUnit])
* Compatible with WebDriver (Selenium 2) and Selenium Grids

If you are still not convinced that Arquillian Drone matches your needs, you might have a look at https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-graphene[Arquillian Graphene 2], which is a wrapper on top of WebDriver, goes one step further and provides you a convenient way how to write tests for rich AJAX UIs with an ease, injections for Page Objects and Page Fragments and much more.

== Getting Started

The following example illustrates how Arquillian Drone can be used with WebDriver:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class WebDriverTest {
 
    static final String USERNAME = "demo";
    static final String PASSWORD = "demo";
 
    @ArquillianResource
    URL contextPath;
 
    @Drone
    WebDriver driver;
 
    /**
     * Creates a testing WAR application
     *
     * @return WebArchive to be tested
     */
    @Deployment(testable = false)
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return Deployments.createDeployment();
    }
 
    @Test
    @InSequence(1)
    public void login() {
        LoginPage page = new LoginPage(driver, contextPath);
        page.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD);
    }
 
    @Test
    @InSequence(2)
    public void logout() {
        LoginPage page = new LoginPage(driver, contextPath);
        page.logout();
    }
}
----

You need to put following configuration to the pom.xml file of your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Arquillian Core dependencies -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian</groupId>
            <artifactId>arquillian-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Arquillian Drone dependencies and WebDriver/Selenium dependencies -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
            <artifactId>arquillian-drone-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian.drone}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <!-- To use Arquillian Graphene (2) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.graphene</groupId>
        <artifactId>graphene-webdriver</artifactId>
        <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian.graphene2}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

NOTE: You can use +graphene-webdriver+ dependency chain even if you are willing to use plain WebDriver. 
    Graphene will just bring you more goodies but it does not force you to change a single line of your code

Nevertheless, if you still don't want to add the Graphene dependencies and just use the plain WebDriver, use this Drone dependency chain:
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
        <artifactId>arquillian-drone-webdriver-depchain</artifactId>
        <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian.drone}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

== Automatic Download
Drone provides a functionality of automatic download of some binaries such as browser webdriver and Selenium Server jar. Which binaries and which features are supported can be found in tables below.

=== How it works?

Let say that I want to use Chrome for my UI tests. First of all, Drone checks if the path to the webdriver binary isn't already set. In this case it would check a system property `webdriver.chrome.driver`; if this is empty then it checks arquillian.xml property: `chromeDriverBinary`. In case that both properties are empty, then the automatic download comes up.

Now we have several options how to specify which binary should be downloaded and where it should be stored. For storage purposes cache directories `$HOME/.arquillian/drone/subdirectory_specific_to_binary` are used so the binaries are not downloaded over and over again.

==== Version
Using a property

`<property name="chromeDriverVersion">2.10</property>`

you can define which version of the Chrome webdriver should be downloaded. The binary is then cached in a directory `$HOME/.arquillian/drone/chrome/2.10/`.

==== URL
Using a property

`<property name="chromeDriverUrl">http://url/to/chrome/webdriver </property>`

you can define which url the Chrome webdriver should be downloaded from. The directory where it is stored depends if you also specify the version of this binary or not. In case you use also the before-mentioned property `chromeDriverVersion` then it is cached in corresponding directory `$HOME/.arquillian/drone/chrome/specified_version/`; otherwise it is downloaded into `$project.directory/target/drone/downloaded/` so no cache is used.

==== Latest
In case that you don't define any property then Drone finds the latest version of the given binary and downloads this one. The binary (in case of Chrome webdriver) is cached at `$HOME/.arquillian/drone/chrome/latest_version/`.

=== Activate / Deactivate

The automatic download functionality is activated by default; if you want to set it off use the property:

`<property name="downloadBinaries">false</property>`

and no binary will be downloaded.

== Building the project

Prerequisites:

* JDK 8 and newer
* Maven 3.0.3 and newer

=== Running test suite

You can use Arquillian Spacelift to gather all the required binaries. Just run:

[source]
----
./gradlew test
----

This will run tests using multiple Arquillian Core versions and _phantomjs_ browser. In case you want to modify 
the behavior, you can specify +-ParquillianCoreVersions=1.1.12+ and +-Pbrowser=phantomjs,firefox+ for instance.
This will run integration test using a cross product of Arquillian Core and browsers defined.

WARNING: Running testsuite this way will modify all _pom.xml_ files in the project. Make sure you have committed all
your changes there first.

==== Manual way to run test suite

Prerequisites:

* running Selenium Server at port 4444, with paths to binaries required for remote browser execution. If you don't do it by yourself, Drone will run an instance of Selenium Server automatically. However in this case the server is started and stopped for each test class separately and only in a standalone mode with only one parameter `-port` that is taken from defined remoteAddress.
+
In case you want to specify other arguments to the selenium server, you can do so using the property,
+
`<property name="seleniumServerArgs">-debug -role hub -browserTimeout 1000</property>`
+
So, if you are fine with this automatic behavior you can skip this step, otherwise run your Selenium Server.

* installed web browsers you want to test
* you might want to align your layout to be the same as paths to binaries specified within arquillian.xml in _drone-webdriver_ module. Alternatively, you can override properties with 
 +-Darq.extension.${extensionQualifier}.${propertyName}+

In order to start Selenium Server, execute:

[source,bash]
java -Dphantomjs.binary.path=/path/to/phantomjs.binary -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=/path/to/iedriverserver.binary -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.0.1.jar

Once Selenium Server is running, you can run the tests by:

[source,bash]
mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=${browser}

Where browser has the same value as browser property from _arquillian.xml_ you want to tests (e.g. firefox, chrome, phantomjs, internetExplorer, opera, etc.)

TIP: VNC server instance can be used to let all the browsers pop out in separate display. Just prepend both commands with +DISPLAY=:${display.number}+

=== Releasing new version

Run following commands:

[source,bash]
mvn clean release:prepare release:perform

Make sure that you push the tag, close all issues with given version in JIRA and mark version as released.
