[NOTE]
It is not required to use Arquillian Drone with the exact version we
certified. You can override versions via `<dependencyManagement>`, as
explained in the
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HowDoISpecifyTheSeleniumVersionInArquillianDrone[Arquillian
FAQ].

If you are in doubt what to use for a newly created project, Arquillian
team recommends you to start with Graphene, which is based on WebDriver,
however brings you a lot of AJAX goodies.
